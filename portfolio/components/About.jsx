               <p>I’ve spent years immersed in frontend development, driven by a passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly web experiences. From mastering the nuances of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to building dynamic applications with React, I’m constantly pushing myself to learn and grow.</p>
               <p>or the past 10 years, I’ve been a stay-at-home parent, which has honed my ability to manage time effectively, prioritize tasks, and adapt to new challenges. This experience has strengthened my organizational skills and resilience, qualities I bring to every project I undertake.</p>
